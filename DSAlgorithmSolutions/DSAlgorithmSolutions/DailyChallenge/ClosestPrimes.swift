 2523. Closest Prime Numbers in Range

 Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:

 left <= num1 < num2 <= right .
 Both num1 and num2 are prime numbers.
 num2 - num1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
 Return the positive integer array ans = [num1, num2]. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the smallest num1 value. If no such numbers exist, return [-1, -1].

  

 Example 1:

 Input: left = 10, right = 19
 Output: [11,13]
 Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
 The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
 Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
 Example 2:

 Input: left = 4, right = 6
 Output: [-1,-1]
 Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= left <= right <= 106
